# file-stats
Reads in a file and generates simple statistics on the file

Python program reads the contents of a file and determines the number of words in the file, the number of non-blank lines in the file, and average number of words per nonblank line. The file is specified by the user through an input prompt.  A word is defined as any group of contiguous non-blank characters separated from other characters by whitespace. The file frontiero_v_richardson.txt is provided as an example to test the application with the expected output of:
   Total number of words: 1271
   Total number of lines: 61
   Average number of words per line: 20.8
